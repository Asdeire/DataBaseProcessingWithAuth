# Data Base Processing With Authorisation Service
## Objective
The objective of this practical work is to define the responsibility of the service layer and to learn to develop business logic using the service method.


## Overview
In this practical work, the focus is on building a service layer to encapsulate the business logic of the application. By separating concerns into distinct services, we enhance maintainability, scalability, and testability of the codebase.

Service Layer:
The service layer serves as an intermediary between the presentation layer (UI/Controllers) and the data access layer (Repositories). Its primary responsibility is to implement business logic and coordinate interactions between different parts of the system.

## Tasks
Task 1: Refactor Validation
Refactor the validation logic from the previous practical work into separate services if it hasn't been done already. This involves extracting validation code from other parts of the application and organizing it into dedicated service classes.

Task 2: Create Authentication Service
Implement an authentication service responsible for authenticating users. This service should handle tasks such as verifying user credentials and generating authentication tokens.

Task 3: Authorization Service (Optional)
Implement an authorization service similar to "NoteAccessValidation". This service should handle granting access rights to users based on their roles. You can define the logic for role-based access control (RBAC) within this service.
## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the validation script.
- Follow the instructions provided to input data and observe the validation process.
